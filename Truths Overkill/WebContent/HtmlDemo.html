		<p class="formatted-par">We'll play with clouds today. We don't
			have anything but happy trees here. Use absolutely no pressure. Just
			like an angel's wing. Let's put some happy little clouds in our
			world.</p>

		<p class="formatted-par">When things happen - enjoy them. They're
			little gifts. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Working it up
			and down, back and forth. Even trees need a friend. We all need
			friends. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Steve wants
			reflections, so let's give him reflections.</p>

		<p>Imagination is the key to painting. Just beat the devil out of
			it. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. We must be
			quiet, soft and gentle. It's all a game of angles. A thin paint will
			stick to a thick paint.</p>

		<p>Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build
			the framework first. If you don't think every day is a good day - try
			missing a few. You'll see. Son of a gun. We'll put a happy little sky
			in here. All kinds of happy little splashes.</p>

		<p>Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. If
			you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. Pretend
			you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day.</p>

		<p class="formatted-par">Let's do that again. You can't make a
			mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make
			something beautiful out of it. Let's put a touch more of the magic
			here.</p>
