            <p class="text-right text-warning">We'll play with clouds today. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.</p>

            <p class="text-left text-danger">When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Working it up and down, back and forth. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.</p>
            
            <p class="text-nowrap text-info">Imagination is the key to painting. Just beat the devil out of it. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. It's all a game of angles. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint.</p>
            
            <p class="text-justify text-success">Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Son of a gun. We'll put a happy little sky in here. All kinds of happy little splashes.</p>
            
            <p class="text-center">Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day.</p>
            
            <p class="">Let's do that again. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Let's put a touch more of the magic here.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-sm-8">Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. Just beat the devil out of it. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Let's make a happy little mountain now. Put it in, leave it alone. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun.</p>

                <p class="col-sm-4">As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. And right there you got an almighty cloud. Every time you practice, you learn more. It takes dark in order to show light. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Let's have a happy little tree in here. Everybody needs a friend. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.</p>
